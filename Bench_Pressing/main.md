# Bench Pressing


<br>
What is this? It's a basic guide to the numbers you want to hit to fight monsters at specific tiers. It'll be broken down by how strong the PD/MD/SD is and how strong the attacks against the players' PD/MD/SD are. I will have an "expected debuffs" table broken down by ECR to show how many on average there are.
