# Bench Pressing


<br>
What is this? It's a basic guide to the numbers you want to hit to fight monsters at specific tiers. It'll be broken down by how strong the PD/MD/SD is and how strong the attacks against the players' PD/MD/SD are. I will have an "expected debuffs" table broken down by ECR to show how many on average there are. This will also serve as a way to create monsters. I will design a "points" system based on the Bench Pressing Guide. I am heavily inspired by this: [Bench Pressing v1](https://rpgwillikers.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/bench-pressing-character-creation-by-the-numbers/) and [Bench Pressing v2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CvlqyaockPeeL56je7y1Fba7npoJXeJoYNPUOtprBEs/edit#gid=0)
