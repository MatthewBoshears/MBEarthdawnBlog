# Physical Defense

<br>
This is a breakdown of the physical defense of every monster at each Circle Rating available in the books. This guide considers Horrors to be Circle Rating in the book +1, as this is the standard in Earthdawn Westmarches. This means you want your effective attack step to average this or higher if you want to hit the monster.
