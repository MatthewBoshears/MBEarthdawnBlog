# Unconciousness

<br>
This is a breakdown of the unconciousness of every monster at each Circle Rating available in the books. This guide considers Horrors to be Circle Rating in the book +1, as this is the standard in Earthdawn Westmarches.
<br>
Some tables still have horrors. Horrors will be removed later.
