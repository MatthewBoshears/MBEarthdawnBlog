# Hitting Mystical Armor

<br>
You won't be hitting mystical armor enough times to kill a monster alone. But you should know what spells are likely to wound.
<br>
<br>
This is a "simple" table with the stated goal of dealing a wound to a monster. There's very few spells that you can boost enough to reliably wound without weaving extra threads. My ballpark is that you can reliably deal wounds with a single target damage spell around C5. And then not after that without weaving threads.
