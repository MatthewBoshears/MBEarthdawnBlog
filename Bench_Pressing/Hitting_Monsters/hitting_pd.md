# Hitting Physical Defense

<br>
This is a "simple" table with the stated goal of hitting a monster with 86% of Physical-based attacks (karma not included). This chart is referencing [step deviation table](/bench_pressing/step_deviation_table) here. Which calculate average - 1 SD. Then the step for that is placed in the chart.
<br>
Remember that karma is +4. So if you have a PER of 7 and an attack talent rank of 6, you have an ESV of 13 without karma. 17 with karma. This means you can hit Physical defense 10 >86% of the time. If you blindside, this is equal to an effective +2.
