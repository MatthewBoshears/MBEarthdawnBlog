# Hitting Player Physical Armor

<br>
This is a "simple" table with the stated goal of not getting hit by monsters. These are not all achievable. This is fine. You are meant to be hit. This is just to show you, on average, what WT+PA you should have. I have looked at the Average Step's effect in Anydice, ignored explosions, and gone 1 standard deviation above the average. I rounded to the nearest number, not always up. This means you will be wounded by approximately 15% of damages. This does not include Karma.
<br>
It is better to have more PA than WT, but the value here is just your total. The PA you want is the Dmg Avg.
<br>

At the end is a list of the standard buffs found at each circle in the GMG. I have not done the Companion yet. I will. Anyway, stats:

### Circle 7

|-------------------|------------|----------------|

| Buff              | WT+PA Goal | Dmg Avg        |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| Base              | 26         | 23             |
| Ambush 10         | 50         | 39             |

Here's how each is calculated:
<br>
Ambush X is calculated as being equal to X/2.5 + X + 2 damage. Ambush 5 is 9 damage. Ambush X/2.5 is for extra successes, X is the ambush itself, +2 is from surprised (rounding up, this is designed to be a worst case scenario chart). This expects you to not be wielding a shield. If you are wearing a shield, you'll take extra damage. Every 5 PD lost is 2 damage. So most likely 1-2 damage extra. Calculate this yourself. I trust you.
<br>
Dive/Charge X is calculated as being equal to  X/2.5 + X damage. If your GM is tactically inclined and blindsides a lot, add 1 more damage.
<br>
Surprise Strike X is calculated as being equal to X+1 damage. This is to include blindsiding and being knocked down.
<br>
Harried is equal to 1 extra damage. It is not included in this chart. It is not worth the space.
<br>
This is only for the average. To account for a "true" bench pressing experience, add the difference between avg and high * 1.25 and round up for each circle. So for Circle 2, 13-11 is 2. Add 25% more. Round up. 3.
