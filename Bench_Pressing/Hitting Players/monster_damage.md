# Hitting Physical Armor

<br>
This is a simple table showing the physical damage of monsters. This only shows the first attack. I may adjust this in the future. This is not wholly accurate due to this limitation. some of the names are also only partial complete. I value getting the ballpark data set out before I care about polishing the original. These were all generated by the generate_guide.py script found in the repository.
