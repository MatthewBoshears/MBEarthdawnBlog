Greetings. I am PrototypeInSession. I am sometimes called Matthew B. This is a page that will link to a series of statistics, monsters, etc I make for in Earthdawn Westmarches. [Discord link](https://discord.gg/jrZRFeR5wr). I run games there pretty often. It's free. Join if you want.

I am not web developer. I do not know how to develop webpages. I did 90% of the front end (javascript) of this website with Gemini. I will attempt to do things correctly. Inform me at prototypeinsession+blog@gmail.com if I've made an error. The "blog" tag will flag it in my filters. Please use it or it's getting blackholed.

If you want to contribute, send me a pull request [here](https://github.com/MatthewBoshears/MBEarthdawnBlog). Or, honestly, don't. Just message me on discord. My discord name is prototypeinsession.

I don't own the rights to this game. Please buy the Earthdawn stuff from FASA [here](https://shop.fasagames.com/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1_102). I bought all my PDFs from there and drivethrurpg (not linked). No referral code, just give 'em money. I recommend the core PDF, the Compendium, Mystic Paths, Questors, and Deeper Secrets as your "core" books.

I don't make any money from this. I don't plan to make any money from this. I'm just some guy that like Earthdawn 4th Edition and Statistics.
