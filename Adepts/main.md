# Adepts


<br>
I am referring to these not by the actual level of the adepts, but by the difficulty of the monster.
<br>
Standard monster manual style.
<br>
This is the table of contents to refer to the circles of adepts. These characters are trimmed down of useless talents to make using them as simple as possible. 
<br>
Within the roll20 system there is currently no way I know of to automate adding spells using an import. So I have added them as basic weapons. In the description it will list that it targets MA. Click the "damage" button any token and use that menu to apply the damage from attacks that hit mystic armor. It's not that slow of a process once you get used to it. If you wish, properly enable spells in the "parameters" tab and give them the appropriate spells. Adepts here will be modified when I figure out the automation or it is supported.
