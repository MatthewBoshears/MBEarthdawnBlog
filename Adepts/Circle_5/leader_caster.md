Here's the stat block for a C5 Warrior Wizard gish "leader".
<br>
I do not do loot.
<br>
This is a modified form of the Silver Branch Magician Sergeant.
<br>
Broadly speaking they follow this action flow:
<br>
Round #1: Tactics, Mind Dagger.
<br>
Round #2-N:
<br>
1) Weave thread, Mind Dagger.
<br>
2) Broadsword x2.
<br>
Broadsword x2 is more effective. If the party is threatening their life, step it up. Waterfall slam the casters. Tactics focus down the squishiest targets.
<br>
If they do not, they value their life. This is not a suicidal soldier. This is a combat veteran.

<br>
Awareness (11): As the talent, Player’s Guide, p. 130.
<br>

<br>
Fearless (5): The Silver Branch magician sergeant gains +5 to their Defenses against fear-based effects.
<br>

<br>
Size Up (10): As the Swordmaster ability, Player's Guide, p. 107. Use this as a secret GM roll to determine knowledge of defenses. This does not cost strain.
<br>
Special Maneuvers:
<br>
Waterfall Slam (Silver Branch Magician Sergeant, Close Combat): The Silver Branch magician sergeant may spend an additional success on an Attack test to force the target to make a Knockdown test against a Difficulty Number equal to the Attack test result.
<br>
<br>
<br>
They should know the following spells:
<br>
Astral Targeting and Astral Sense.
<br>
If the combat is meant to be difficult, they pre-cast Astral Targeting. If not, they don't.
<br>
Astral Sense should always be up.
<br>
This is the lower end version. At the bottom of C5. Here's the higher end version:
<br>
This is not a "full" jump in power level. Just a slight bump overall.
