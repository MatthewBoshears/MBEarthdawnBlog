Here's the stat block for a C8 Warrior Wizard gish "leader".
<br>
I do not do loot.
<br>
This is a modified form of the Adept Warrior Wizard Lieutenant.
<br>
Broadly speaking they follow this action flow:
<br>
Round #1: Tactics, Mind Dagger.
<br>
Round #2-N:
<br>
1) Weave thread, Crushing Will.
<br>
2) Weave thread, Mind Dagger.
<br>
2) Broadsword x2.
<br>
At this CR, they can weave 1 extra thread for effect. I encourage additional target or increased debuff to MD.
Broadsword x2 is more effective. If the party is threatening their life, step it up. Waterfall slam the casters. Tactics focus down the squishiest targets.
<br>
If they do not, they value their life. This is not a suicidal soldier. This is a combat veteran.
<br>
Testing Notes: I am flip-flopping between Step 15 and 16 damage on their Broadsword. I have erred low here. I want to emphasize the magic powers, not the swordsmanship. They are designed to be a "hit more frequently for less" kind of monster. They should take more of a beating without having an outsized personal effect. The monsters are encouraged to act more tactically while this character is alive and less so when they've died. A passive "aura" of tactics. Their casting steps are a little on the higher side for a gish fighter. This is fine. They only cast one spell per round. It should still be far exceeded by the PCs. This is not a boss monster. This is a leader. They're only slightly better than the rank and file.

Adept Warrior Wizard Lieutenant
<br>
Insert lore blurb here later. I'm just putting this here in case it's required by roll20's import feature.
<br>
Challenge: Journeyman (Eighth Circle)
<br>
DEX: 7 Init: 15 Uncon: 62
<br>
STR: 6 PhyDef: 13 Death: 76
<br>
TOU: 7 MysDef: 15 Wound: 10
<br>
PER: 7 SocDef: 11 Knockdown: 13
<br>
WIL: 6 PhyArm: 12 Recovery: 2
<br>
CHA: 6 MysArm: 6 Karma: 4 (12)
<br>
Movement: 12
<br>
Actions: 2; Broadsword: 18 (15), Mind Dagger: 17 (13), Crushing Will: 17 (15)
<br>
Powers:
<br>
Mage Armor (11): This power can be dispelled with a Dispel Magic (11) test. If successful, the Adept Warrior Wizard Lieutenant suffers -3 to Physical Armor.
<br>
Awareness (14): As the talent, Player’s Guide, p. 130.
<br>
Mind Dagger: Targets Mystical Defense and the target suffers -2 to their Physical Defense until the end of the next round.
<br>
Crushing Will: Targets Mystical Defense and the target suffers -2 to their Mystic Defesne until the end of the next round.
<br>
Fearless (5): The Adept Warrior Wizard Lieutenant gains +5 to their Defenses against fear-based effects.
<br>
Tactics (14): As the talent, Player’s Guide, p. 172.
<br>
Size Up (14): As the Swordmaster ability, Player's Guide, p. 107. Use this as a secret GM roll to determine knowledge of defenses. This does not cost strain. Or skip it and learn something about "one" PC per turn. Have the namegiver shout information in the language they speak when learning this if it's relevant to other PCs. Increases engagement in combat.
<br>
Special Maneuvers:
<br>
Waterfall Slam (Adept Warrior Wizard Lieutenant, Close Combat): The Adept Warrior Wizard Lieutenant may spend an additional success on an Attack test to force the target to make a Knockdown test against a Difficulty Number equal to the Attack test result.
<br>
<br>
<br>
They should know the following spells:
<br>
Astral Targeting and Astral Sense. If you wish to make them more powerful, add Astral Shield and chain cast it. This is optional.
<br>
Astral Sense and Astral Targeting should always be up (as if chain cast).
