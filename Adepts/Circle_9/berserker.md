So this monster is one that will abuse the Fury mechanic in a strange way. It is designed to get slaughtered by characters who deal lots of damage at once. This is also optimized to deal with min-maxed characters. If dealing with characters not designed for combat or shenanigans, consider this a tenth circle creature.
