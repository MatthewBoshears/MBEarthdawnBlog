# Tactical Masks
This is a mask designed to make a leader more "tactical" - they're more of a leader and less of a fighter. It is not designed for usage on a solo gigantic monster. It is designed as a force multiplier.
<br>
If your encounter has more than 1.5 monsters per PC, these are probably worth more circles worth of difficulty. Hardened Tactical is better at ECR 6+. Unhardened is better at ECR 1-5 (Novice and start of Journeyman).
